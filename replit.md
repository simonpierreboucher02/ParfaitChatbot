## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework:** React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool

**UI System:** Hybrid approach combining shadcn/ui components with custom dark-first design
- Based on Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom color system
- Design philosophy: "Legendary but Functional" with violet-spectrum branding
- Mobile-first responsive design with glassmorphic effects

**State Management:**
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- React Hook Form with Zod validation for form management
- Wouter for client-side routing (lightweight alternative to React Router)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Dark mode as primary theme with near-black backgrounds (0 0% 3%)
- Violet primary color (#8b5cf6) for brand identity
- Custom CSS variables for theming flexibility
- Inter font family for UI, JetBrains Mono for code elements

### Backend Architecture

**Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js server

**Language:** TypeScript with ES modules

**API Design:** RESTful endpoints with streaming support for chat responses

**Authentication (Public):**
- `/api/register` - User registration with username/password
- `/api/login` - User login (Passport.js local strategy)
- `/api/logout` - User logout
- `/api/user` - Get current authenticated user

**Admin Endpoints (Protected - require authentication):**
- `/api/company` - Company profile management
- `/api/chatbot` - Chatbot configuration
- `/api/documents` - Document management and crawling
- `/api/conversations` - Conversation history
- `/api/analytics` - Usage statistics

**Public Endpoints (No authentication required):**
- `/api/chatbot/:slug` - Get chatbot configuration by company slug
- `/api/chat` - Real-time chat with streaming responses
- `/api/openrouter/models` - Fetch 400+ available LLM models (1-hour cache)
- `/widget.js` - Widget JavaScript file

**Frontend Routes:**

**Public Routes:**
- `/auth` - Login/Register page
- `/chat/:slug` - Standalone fullscreen chatbot (accessible via company slug)

**Protected Routes (require authentication):**
- `/` - Dashboard with key metrics
- `/chatbot` - Chatbot configuration
- `/documents` - Knowledge base management
- `/models` - OpenRouter model marketplace
- `/widget` - Embeddable widget code and standalone chatbot URL
- `/conversations` - Chat history with message details
- `/analytics` - Visitor analytics and geographic map
- `/settings` - Company profile and branding

**Authentication & Multi-Tenancy:**
- **Passport.js** with local strategy for username/password authentication
- **Scrypt** password hashing with salt (secure, memory-hard algorithm)
- **Session-based authentication** using PostgreSQL session store
- **Session security**: httpOnly cookies, sameSite=lax, secure in production, 7-day maxAge
- **Multi-tenant data isolation**: All storage methods filter by userId
- **Protected routes**: requireAuth middleware on all admin API endpoints
- **Company slugs**: Auto-generated URL-safe slugs for public chatbot access

**Key Architectural Patterns:**
- Separation of concerns with dedicated modules (routes, storage, crawler, vector store)
- Repository pattern via storage abstraction layer
- Multi-tenant architecture with complete data isolation per user account
- Streaming responses for real-time chat experience
- Async generators for efficient data streaming

### Data Storage Solutions

**Primary Database:** PostgreSQL via Neon (serverless)
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- Schema-first approach with TypeScript types
- WebSocket-based connection pooling for serverless environment

**Vector Storage:** Hybrid approach
- Database storage for embeddings with JSON array type
- In-memory vector store (vectorStore.ts) for fast similarity search
- File-based persistence (data/vectors.json) for vector cache

**Data Models:**
- Users - Account credentials and authentication (username, hashed password)
- Companies - Business information, branding, and unique slug (linked to userId)
- Chatbots - AI agent configuration (personality, LLM model, temperature)
- Documents - Knowledge base content from uploads/crawls
- Embeddings - Vector representations for RAG retrieval
- Conversations - Session tracking with geolocation
- Messages - Chat history with role-based structure
- CrawlerConfigs - Website crawling settings

**RAG Pipeline:**
1. Content ingestion via crawling or file upload
2. Text chunking (500 words per chunk)
3. Embedding generation using OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
4. Vector storage with metadata linking
5. Similarity search during chat for context retrieval
6. Context injection into LLM prompts

### External Dependencies

  - "Open Chatbot" button launches popup window
  - URL format: `https://[domain]/chat`

### OpenRouter Model Marketplace
- **Model Browser Page** (`/models`): Browse and test 400+ LLM models
  - Search functionality by model name/ID
  - Filter by provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, etc.)
  - Filter by price tier (Free, Low, Medium, High)

### Bug Fixes
- **Conversations Page**: Fixed empty list issue
  - Problem: Filter only checked country/city (all null), hiding all conversations
  - Solution: Show all conversations when search empty, added search by sessionId/IP
  - Display "Unknown Location" when geolocation unavailable
  
- **Geographic Map**: Fixed empty map issue
  - Problem: Private IPs sent to external API causing failures
  - Solution: Added private IP detection, skip API calls for internal IPs
  - Shows appropriate empty state for private IP deployments

- **Model Playground**: Fixed model override in chat endpoint
  - Problem: Playground always used default chatbot model
  - Solution: Added `model` parameter support in `/api/chat`
  - Verified with E2E testing (Claude model identity confirmation)
